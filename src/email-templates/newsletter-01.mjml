          <h3>One clever idea üí°</h3>
          <blockquote>
            The Pygmalion effect, or Rosenthal effect, is the phenomenon whereby
            higher expectations lead to an increase in performance. The effect
            is named after the Greek myth of Pygmalion, a sculptor who fell in
            love with a statue he had carved, or alternately, after the
            Rosenthal‚ÄìJacobson study.

          <h3>Updates from me üöÄ</h3>
          <p>
            These are some extraordinary times. Never before have we seen this
            level of <strong>unprecedented focus</strong> and
            <strong>world-wide collaboration</strong> to solve the same problem.
            Disasters and crises bring out the best in us. Yet, every day we are
            bombarded with only bad news regarding COVID-19. There's a saying
            that ‚ÄúBad news travels fast‚Äù. A growing body of evidence illustrates
            that
            <strong>we pay more attention to negative news than positive</strong
            >. Today's media fight hard for their survival and are very much
            aware of this fact. In addition, the tendency to
            <strong>share negative news on social media is stronger</strong>.
            So, if the number of eyeballs is the success metric for media, then
            there are some very compelling reasons for focusing on what's bad in
            the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've been laying low since the start of the crisis. My focus has
            shifted temporarily from <strong>building SaaS products</strong> to
            <strong>trading the markets</strong>. This truly historical event
            moves the markets in ways never seen before. A daytrader at heart, I
            want to experience it first-hand. 2 weeks in, and I'm already eager
            to get back to only focusing on building products. Trading is more
            stressful to me and not rewarding, in the same way, creating
            something is.
          </p>
          <p>
            Markets aside, I managed to actually get some things done the past
            weeks:

              ‚Äî A look back at the first year since launching
              <a href="https://tayl.app">TAYL</a>, and what I've learned along

              since January 1st and recently passed the 100-mark and closing in
              on 600km (~373 miles). There'll be a blog post about this goal in
              the future.

              <strong>New project:</strong> Graphical profile, design of landing
              page, onboarding and authentication flow is done. The next step is
              building the admin panel and backend.

              <strong>Misc:</strong> I somehow managed to win (!!!) Google's
              Flutter Clock Challenge. It was a fun world-wide
              design/programming competition with thousands of participants. You
              can read more about it in my blog:
