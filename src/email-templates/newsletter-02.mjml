          <h3>One thoughtful quote ü§î</h3>

            original in your work.‚Äù - Gustave Flaubert

          <h3>Searching for co-founders üîé</h3>
          <p>
            I've realised the benefits of working on things together after
            hacking away on my own projects alone for the past 2 years. That's
            why I've now started to ask around for people interested in joining
            me on my next venture. Or perhaps joining me on my latest launch
            (see below).
          </p>

          <p>
            My skills are around product development, coding, design etc. So if
            you're someone that would compliment my skills by being, say... a
            marketing wizard, for example, that would be awesome. But I'm not
            picky, just get in touch if you'd like to build something cool, fun
            or useful together! üëã

          <h3>One clever idea üí°</h3>
          <blockquote>
            The heat from the sauna relaxes the body's muscles, improves
            circulation and stimulates the release of endorphins. Endorphins are
            the body‚Äôs all-natural "feel good" chemical, and their release
            provides a truly wonderful "after sauna glow.‚Äù

          <h3>Updates from me üöÄ</h3>
          <p>
            For the past few months I've been building
            <a href="https://www.podopi.com">Podopi</a>. Perhaps you remember
            <a href="https://www.tayl.app">TAYL</a>? Podopi is similar, but
            aimed towards content creators, such as writers, bloggers and
            medium- to small businesses. Everyone who would like to offer their
            users an <em>exciting</em> alternative to boring, plain old
            long-form text.
          </p>
          <p>
            Podopi works on most blog-like websites and require no coding or
            complex installs. Simply sign up with your website address and the
            app will create a podcast that forever stays in sync with your most
            recent posts. Your fresh blog post automatically gets converted into
            a podcast episode.
          </p>
          <p>
            Find the perfect sound track for your podcast with a library of
            15,000 fully licensed music tracks to choose from. Podopi lets you
            select from 200+ different voices and dialects to best represent
            your brand, and give your content a voice. Podopi generates audio
            and video content that will impress your users.

          <h3>Since we last spoke...</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Shipping:</strong> I'm happy to finally announce that
              <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/podopi/launch-day"
                >Podopi is live</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Connecting:</strong> I'll be honest. Only this week my
              focus has started to shift from building to networking, marketing
              and such. It's not my strong side, so things can only improve from
              here üòÜ
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Learning:</strong> Podopi was built in Elixir, a
              functional programming language I've never used before. Elixir is
              widely different from JavaScript/NodeJS and the tools I'm used to.
              It made the learning curve quite steep, but somewhere halfway down
              the path it all started to "click" for me. Elixir is a beautiful
              language that comes with many benefits from running on the BEAM
              (Erlang virtual machine). Phoenix/Elixir comes packed with many
              great features that makes it possible to ship products and
              features quickly, with confidence.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Maintaining:</strong>
              <a href="https://www.tayl.app">TAYL</a> has been receiving a few
              updates along the way as well. Bug fixes and small tweaks, of
              course. But also plenty of new voices and dialects. There's a new
              feature that allows you to

              by forwarding them to your TAYL inbox. There's a new Changelog in
              the member portal that informs members of updates like these.

              <strong>Running:</strong> Surprisingly, I'm still running. Every
              day since January 1st, 2020. Today is day number 613. This year
              I'm focusing on trail running and slowly increasing daily mileage.
              My feet now average about 5k (3.1 miles) for the whole year and
              currently about 50-70km (31-112 miles) per week.
