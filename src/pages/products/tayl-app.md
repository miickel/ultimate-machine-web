TAYL is a service that turns text content into audio. Instead of consuming text in front of the screen, you can consume audio while outside living your life free of eye-strain.

Save your text content using our premium browser extensions, smartphone apps for iOS or Android, via one of our 1,500+ integrations or simply by typing. We'll keep a readable copy for you, free from ads and other clutter. We'll deliver an audio version of the same content to your private podcast feed. Listen at your convenience.

## Worldwide Opportunity for Growth

The underlying platform supports more than 30 different languages. Users can select from a huge variety of over 200 voices. This product scales easily and has very good growth potential.

## Profitable From Day One

The initial version of TAYL was built in less than 3 months (with me working on it only evenings and weekends). After launching in March 2019, it quickly became profitable within only a couple of hours, due to the low running costs.
